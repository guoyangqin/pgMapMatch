"""Configuration file for pgMapMatch
Make changes here to:
1. Set up your PostgreSQL database, schema, host and user names
2. Set the parameters of the map-matching likelihood functions
3. Provide details on the column names of the streets table
   (if you are not using osm2po)

Save this file as `config.py`.
`config_template.py` will be used only if `config.py` is not found.
